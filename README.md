# ⛓️ Blockchain Wallet Relationship Investigator  
### Solana & Ethereum

---

## 🔎 Overview

An **on-chain, forensic-grade wallet relationship investigator**.

This tool determines whether **two blockchain wallets are meaningfully connected** through real asset flow — not coincidental activity like airdrops, spam tokens, or exchange distributions.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Bidirectional Relationship Search**  
  Traces connections from both wallets simultaneously to efficiently discover the shortest path.

- ⚡ **In-Memory Intelligence Cache**  
  Every scanned wallet is remembered to minimize redundant API calls and avoid rate limits.

- 🛡️ **Spam & Noise Filtering**  
  Detects and ignores common sender patterns (airdrops, faucets, spam) while preserving them as forensic notes.

- 🧭 **Cross-Chain Support**  
  Works seamlessly on **Solana** and **Ethereum**, automatically detecting wallet type.

- 📎 **Evidence-First Results**  
  Every discovered relationship includes direct transaction links for verification.

- 💅 **Readable, Investigator-Friendly UI**  
  Clean dark-mode dashboard with shortened address formatting (`0x1234…abcd`).

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Parallel Expansion**  
   Both wallets are explored outward at the same time.

2. **Relationship Evaluation**  
   Intersections are analyzed for fund flow direction.

3. **Spam & Noise Filtering**  
   Common sender-only overlaps are ignored.

4. **Path Reconstruction**  
   Meaningful connections are rebuilt with verified transaction links.
